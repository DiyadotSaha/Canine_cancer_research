We did not identify additional mutations, including in new regions of PTPN11. \r\n\r\nAn integrated review of this patient's genomic data, as well as clinical history and pathology reports, supports the diagnosis of histiocytic sarcoma.

In human cancers, deletion of and certain mutations within exon 14 are gain-of-function oncogenic events, which have been associated with sensitivity to MET inhibitors, such as crizotinib, tepotinib, or capmatinib in non-small cell lung cancer (PMID: 31932802, 32469185, 32877583).

Most mutations were shared between samples including those in ATM, ATRX, CDK6, CDKN2B, FANCG, KDR, KIT, MET, MYC, PDGFRA, SMO, and TP53, consistent with the clinical history and pathology review that the two lesions are related. We also detected additional mutations in the mammary gland tumor sample (FBXW7 copy number loss and MET copy number gain) not present in the lymph node lesion and one mutation unique to the lymph node lesion - the BAP1 Ile239Met mutation, shown as a Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS) on page 9 of the lymph node report. The mutations that occur in multiple neoplastic lesions from the same patient, even related primary and metastatic lesions, can vary between lesions due to differences in the timing of metastasis, branching cancer evolution, and other factors. In this case, we recommend leveraging the abundant treatment-related biomarkers that are shared between the primary gland mass and the lymph node metastasis in order to guide treatment planning.\r\n\r\nMutations with therapeutic and prognostic associations in the mammary gland lesion are described on pages 2 and 3.

The human equivalent of CCND1 Glu316del is Glu280del, which has been found infrequently in human cancers, such as large intestine and endometrium carcinoma. This mutation is computationally predicted to be deleterious and may play a pathogenic role in these tumors. Other CCND1 pathogenic mutations, such as amplification, have been associated with sensitivity to sorafenib, when combined with carboplatin and paclitaxel, in a Phase III trial for human melanoma patients. (PMID:26307133) Although the therapeutic association of CCND1 Glu316del with sorafenib has yet to be fully explored in people and dogs, we are providing this information in light of the absence of other available targeted agents. \r\n\r\nBoth samples passed all DNA quality metrics and has been confirmed by histology to contain sufficient viable nucleated cells for sequencing, with the tumor fraction estimated to be 95%. Although limited genomic data is available for canine anal sac apocrine gland adenocarcinoma, SearchLight DNA does cover genes that are commonly mutated in canine/human cancers and bear therapeutic associations, such as PTEN, PIK3CA, and RAS, and we have high confidence that we would have identified such mutations in these samples were they present in SearchLight DNA's target regions.\r\n\r\nThis test evaluated 120 cancer genes in the submitted sample.

SL24-000018,"Mutations in KIT have been commonly found in canine mast cell tumor. Therefore, genomics is consistent with Vidium's pathology reading by Drs Barb Powers, Jeff Edwards and Derick Whitley, supporting that this is a mast cell tumor. KIT Asp695Tyr (annotated as a variant of uncertain significance on page 4) has been found sporadically in human cancers, and is predicted to be a deleterious mutation that may lead to gain-of-function of KIT. KIT activating mutations have been associated with treatment sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as toceranib and imatinib. (PMID:19470739, 28196207) Although the pathogenicity of KIT Asp695Tyr and the therapeutic association of KIT Asp695Tyr with toceranib and imatinib have yet to be explored in dogs with cancer, we are providing this information because of the absence of other therapeutic biomarkers and targeted agents.\r\n\r\nThis test evaluated 120 cancer genes in the submitted sample.

SL24-000310,"An integrated review of the genomic data, as well as clinical history and pathology review, supports the diagnosis of histiocytic sarcoma. Specifically, mutations in PTPN11 have been commonly found in canine histiocytic sarcoma. This particular PTPN11 Phe71Leu is annotated as a variant of uncertain significance on page 9 because it has not yet been included in our knowledgebase.\r\n\r\nNotably, we identified mutations with therapeutic associations, as described on page 2. In addition, PTPN11 activating mutations, such as Phe71Leu, have been associated with sensitivity to MEK inhibitor, trametinib, based on preclinical studies in canine histiocytic sarcoma cell lines. (PMID:32212266; 30135215). Although the therapeutic association between PTPN11 Phe71Leu with trametinib has yet to be rigorously explored in dogs, we are providing this information due to the potential driver role of PTPN11 mutation in this case. This therapeutic association was not captured through our automated pipeline and thus was not displayed on the report, because the specific associations have not been included in our knowledgebase based on our current inclusion criteria or our curation updating cadence.\r\n\r\nThe most compelling evidence supports the initial consideration of the combination of trametinib and sirolimus targeting PTPN11 and PTEN, followed by palbociclib targeting CDKN2B, and imatinib targeting PDGFRA, which are the top 3 therapeutic associations based on mutation-level evidence of pathogenicity, tumor-type-specificity, as well as drug availability/safety/toxicity and evidence levels for the therapeutic biomarker associations in the report.
